# Frozenset is an unordered collection of data type
# that is iterable, immutable and has no duplicate elements

# Frozenset will not have manipulator functions since they are immutable

# Frozen sets in Python are "immutable" objects that only support methods 
# and operators that produce a result without affecting the frozen set or 
# sets to which they are applied

# Creating a frozen Set 
String = ('G', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's', 'F', 'o', 'r') 
Fset1 = frozenset(String) 
print("The FrozenSet is: ") 
print(Fset1)
